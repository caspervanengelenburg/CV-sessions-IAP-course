# Computer Vision for Interactive Architecture Prototypes

Welcome to the repository on the Computer vision part of the Interactive Architecture Prototypes master course given at Delft University of Technology. In this part of the course the following questions are investigated:

- *Why do we need Computer vision in semi-automatic building processes?*
- *How to develop Computer vision techniques (hands-on) that allow for efficient and effective human-robotic interaction?*

Google Colaboratory and Python are used for all sessions; both will be introduced in the lecture and tutorials. Until now, the CV part of the course consists of two consecutive session. First, the use of Python and general image processing techniques are introduced. Second, specific Python pipelines are developed which are tailored towards the specific problem setting of the corresponding year that the course is given. (Note that every year different structures and materials are used.)

For every course year, a seperate folder exits where you can the files for the specific assignments (`assignment_<year>`). (Note that eventhough we reuse many of the course materials, the materials generally develop, hence they change, every year.)
